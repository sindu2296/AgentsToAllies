# Job Recommendation with Microsoft Agent Framework

This project demonstrates how to build a modular job recommendation system using **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** with multi-agent sequential orchestration.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Try the Streamlit UI

### Launch the Interactive Web UI
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**The easiest way to get started!** Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501` and:
1. Enter your job profile (e.g., "Python developer with 3 years AWS experience")
2. Watch the 3-stage workflow execute in real-time
3. Get personalized job recommendations with match explanations
4. Download results as text files

**No configuration needed** - Just run the command above!

---

## Overview

This implementation showcases:
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for extraction, recommendation, and summarization
- **Sequential Orchestration**: Jobs flow through agents in a predictable, ordered manner
- **Function Tools**: SerpAPI integration as a MAF function tool
- **Azure OpenAI**: Powered by Azure OpenAI with API key authentication

## Architecture

### Agents

1. **Job Extractor Agent**
   - Uses SerpAPI (Google Jobs) to search for jobs based on user profile
   - Returns job listings as JSON
   - Tool: `search_jobs` function

2. **Job Recommender Agent**
   - Analyzes jobs and matches them to user's skills/experience
   - Ranks jobs by relevance
   - Adds `match_reason` to explain why each job fits
   - Returns top 3-5 recommendations as JSON

3. **Job Summary Agent**
   - Creates executive summaries (5 bullets each) of recommended jobs
   - Highlights: responsibilities, qualifications, skills, benefits, match reason
   - Returns human-readable text

### Workflow

The orchestrator uses Microsoft Agent Framework's **`SequentialBuilder`** to create a pipeline where each agent processes the conversation in turn:

```python
from agent_framework import SequentialBuilder

# Build sequential workflow
workflow = (
    SequentialBuilder()
    .participants([extractor, recommender, summarizer])
    .build()
)

# Run the workflow
async for event in workflow.run_stream(user_profile):
    if isinstance(event, WorkflowCompletedEvent):
        completion = event
```

```
User Profile 
    ↓
[Job Extractor Agent] → Searches SerpAPI
    ↓
[Job Recommender Agent] → Ranks & filters
    ↓
[Job Summary Agent] → Creates summaries
    ↓
Final Output (Complete Conversation)
```

**Key Feature**: Each agent sees the full conversation history and adds their response, building a complete dialogue through the pipeline.

```

## Setup

1. Ensure you have the virtual environment activated:
   ```powershell
   .\env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source env/bin/activate  # Unix/MacOS
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Example

Navigate to the job_recommendation_maf directory:
```powershell
cd job_recommendation_maf
```

Run the sequential orchestration:
```powershell
python -m src.main_sequential
```

## Key Differences from Semantic Kernel Version

| Feature | Microsoft Agent Framework | Semantic Kernel |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Agent Creation | `chat_client.create_agent()` | `ChatCompletionAgent(kernel, ...)` |
| Client | `AzureOpenAIChatClient` | `AsyncAzureOpenAI` + `AzureChatCompletion` |
| Tools/Plugins | Function tools (Python functions) | Kernel plugins with `@kernel_function` |
| Orchestration | `SequentialBuilder().participants([...]).build()` | `SequentialOrchestration` + `InProcessRuntime` |
| Execution | `workflow.run_stream()` → `WorkflowCompletedEvent` | `orchestration.invoke()` → `.get(timeout)` |
| Conversation | Full conversation history in result | Agent responses only |

## Notes

- The Microsoft Agent Framework provides a streamlined, Pythonic approach to building agents
- Uses **`SequentialBuilder`** from MAF for pipeline orchestration (based on [official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/orchestrations/sequential?pivots=programming-language-python))
- Function tools are simpler than Semantic Kernel plugins (just Python functions)
- Each agent sees the full conversation history and adds their response
- The workflow returns a `WorkflowCompletedEvent` with complete conversation flow
- Agents automatically handle tool/function calling when needed

## Comparison with Other Implementations

- **`job_recommendation/`** - Uses Semantic Kernel with `SequentialOrchestration` + `InProcessRuntime`
- **`job_recommendation_maf/`** (this folder) - Uses Microsoft Agent Framework with `SequentialBuilder`
- Both achieve the same goal with different frameworks and patterns
